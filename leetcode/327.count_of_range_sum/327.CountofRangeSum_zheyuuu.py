#
# Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums that lie in [lower, upper] inclusive.
# Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums between indices i and j (i &le; j), 
# inclusive.
# 
# Note:
# A naive algorithm of O(n2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Input: nums = [-2,5,-1], lower = -2, upper = 2,
# Output: 3 
# Explanation: The three ranges are : [0,0], [2,2], [0,2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 	0 <= nums.length <= 10^4
