#
# You are given two sorted arrays of distinct integers nums1 and nums2.
# 
# A valid path is defined as follows:
# 
# 	Choose array nums1 or nums2 to traverse (from index-0).
# 	Traverse the current array from left to right.
# 	If you are reading any value that is present in nums1 and nums2 you are allowed to change 
# your path to the other array. (Only one repeated value is considered in the valid path).
# 
# Score is defined as the sum of uniques values in a valid path.
# 
# Return the maximum score you can obtain of all possible valid paths.
# 
# Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: nums1 = [2,4,5,8,10], nums2 = [4,6,8,9]
# Output: 30
# Explanation: Valid paths:
# [2,4,5,8,10], [2,4,5,8,9], [2,4,6,8,9], [2,4,6,8,10],  (starting from nums1)
# [4,6,8,9], [4,5,8,10], [4,5,8,9], [4,6,8,10]    (starting from nums2)
# The maximum is obtained with the path in green [2,4,6,8,10].
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: nums1 = [1,3,5,7,9], nums2 = [3,5,100]
# Output: 109
# Explanation: Maximum sum is obtained with the path [1,3,5,100].
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5], nums2 = [6,7,8,9,10]
# Output: 40
# Explanation: There are no common elements between nums1 and nums2.
# Maximum sum is obtained with the path [6,7,8,9,10].
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# Input: nums1 = [1,4,5,8,9,11,19], nums2 = [2,3,4,11,12]
# Output: 61
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 	1 <= nums1.length <= 10^5
# 	1 <= nums2.length <= 10^5
# 	1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^7
# 	nums1 and nums2 are strictly increasing.
