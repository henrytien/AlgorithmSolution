# 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

## Question

Given a **complete** binary tree, count the number of nodes.

**Note:**

**Definition of a complete binary tree from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees):**
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

**Example:**

```
Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6

Output: 6
```

## Ideas

Intuition: count the nodes recursively one by one.

Improved: Binary Search.

* Except for the last level, the nodes are filled, which is 2^(d - 1).

* Therefore, we only need to count the number of nodes in the last level.

* How to check how many nodes are in the last level?

  * Use a binary search to check it. We first check the left child at the middle, so we need to set `left = 1`. Move the mid to the right one.

  * We construct a path to find out that node we want to check. 

    * We choose a new mid point as a pivot.
  * If the mid is greater than the pivot, it must be on the right. So we move to the right branch.
    * If the mid is less than that pivot,  it must be on the left. So we move to the left branch.
  

## Highlights

**Take use of the characteristics**

**Key: how to construct the path to find out the node to check?**
